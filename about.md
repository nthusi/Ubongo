The Ubongo campaign was started in 2002 with the aim of promoting the field of neuroscience amongst primary, secondary, and university students. Since that time, Ubongo campaign has been teaching students on brain awareness, the importance of basic knowledge of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and behavioral neurophysiology with the aim of improving their basic understanding of brain function and how it controls human behavior.

Being the Kenyan Chapter of the International Brain Awareness, Ubongo holds its campaign during the brain awareness week.
In addition to the brain awareness week event, the Ubongo campaign held a public lecture on the History of Neuroscience with Prof. Richard Brown (Dalhousie University) at the University of Nairobi Kenyatta National Hospital campus on 13th December 2022, a high school student workshop on neuroscience, neurophysiology, and on neuroanatomy at the University of Nairobi Chiromo campus on Saturday 20th May 2023, facilitated the transport of two Ubongo representatives to the AMPATH Neuroscience Stakeholder workshop on Friday 26th May and Saturday 27th May in Eldoret, Kenya, and made a presentation at the Neuroscience and Brain Health: Innovations, Research, and Collaborations conference at the Aga Khan University in Nairobi, Kenya on Monday 29th May 2023.

The Brain Awareness Week Campaign, a joint venture between IBRO, DABI (the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives), SfN (Society for Neuroscience), EDAB (the European Dana Alliance for the Brain) and FENS (the federation of European neuroscience Associations) is a global campaign aimed at increasing public awareness on neuroscience and the progress and benefits of brain research.
The Kenya National Brain Bee Contest Champion 2023 was 17 year old Martin Ayuka, a student at Sunshine Secondary School.

# This Year's Objectives

The following objectives were decided for this year’s Brain Awareness 2023 events:
1. Elevate mental health awareness among Kenyan youth, specifically targeting those in high school and medical school.
2. Educate students on the significance of brain health within the broader context of overall well-being, while also introducing the potential of a career in neuroscience.
3. Motivate the younger generation to emerge as the forthcoming cadre of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, and thought leaders. These individuals will be pivotal in advancing research, shaping policy, and devising effective interventions.
4. Prioritize engagement with students from underprivileged schools, ensuring equitable distribution and awareness of neuroscience knowledge throughout Kenya.
